      <i>Disclaimer: This is a piece I wrote for my final essay in my Film Methods class at the University of the Arts London last May. Because of that, it leans very academic, although I’m still very proud of it and think it’s a fun read. I know you are all immensely invested in the future of this website, so do not worry! I intend to write more specifically for this blog in the future, I have not forgotten about it. Anyway, catch y’all later.</i>
      <div class="text-divider"></div>
      <p class="indented">With all the comforts and ease of the modern age, one can easily indulge in the perverse fantasy of a post-apocalyptic world. It’s easy to imagine what a return to pure rugged individual survivalism would look like, and who would inhabit this new world. These are the ideas addressed by most post-apocalyptic cinema, and no film series has been more influential on the genre than the <i>Mad Max</i> franchise. Set in the aftermath of a vague resource war, the series follows Max, his journeys in the wasteland, and his run-ins with the madness that lies therein. I intend to analyze the mise en scène (stage design and setting) of the apocalypse and American iconography in <i>Mad Max 2</i> (1981) and how both reflect traditionally patriarchal heteronormative ideals and what <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> (2015) has altered to make the post-apocalypse a more feminist and inclusive space.</p>
      <p class="indented">It is no secret that much of <i>Mad Max 2</i> draws heavily from the mythos of the American Western genre films; horses replaced with cars, the desert with the Australian outback wasteland, and Native Americans replaced by BDSM attire clad ‘bikies’. Max Rockatansky, dubbed the ‘Road Warrior’ in the narration that precedes the film, is a lone wanderer and a reluctant hero to the people of Pappagallo’s settlement.  It is no surprise, then, that much of Max’s DNA is drawn from the heroes of the western, the wandering and silent anti-heroes of the 50s and 60s. As Rebecca Johinke interrogates in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14443050109387646" class="normal-link">her article</a>, Max too reflects the hyper-masculine heteronormative ideals of these Western heroes. Johinke suggests that Miller attempts to have Max appear “as a pin-up boy for heterosexuality” and that “his standing as the dominant male is never seriously challenged by other male characters.” Max rarely speaks, and his insistence on helping settlers only for the promise of gas (called ‘guzzoline’ in the film) cloaks his true altruism underneath the surface. Max is the perfect American ideal of the ‘rugged individualist’, as J. Emmet Win identifies in <a href="https://openjournals.uwaterloo.ca/index.php/kinema/article/view/839" class="normal-link">his article</a>. Win suggests that “Max appears as an American legend, complete with a sawed-off shotgun on his hip.” Thus Max takes the status of the “mythological Western hero,” a point insisted by Miller throughout the trilogy, with <i>Mad Max 2</i> specifically telling his story from the perspective of an old man who once knew Max as a child.</p>
      <p class="indented">Max’s mythological and heteronormative status is only reinforced by the milieu of the apocalypse, something he is well-equipped and resourceful enough to survive in. <a href="https://researchportal.murdoch.edu.au/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/The-apocalypse-is-masculine--Masculinities/991005544502707891" class="normal-link">Briohny Doyle assesses</a> the interaction between the narrative of the ‘survivalist’ and masculinity, and identifies two reactions to the apocalypse, the ‘tough guy outsider’ and the ‘yuppy in crisis’. Max, with his survival, driving, and combat skills, easily fits into the ‘tough guy outsider’ camp. Doyle draws from Michel Foucault in naming spaces as ‘crisis heterotopias’, spaces where individuals remain in a state of crisis. Doyle asserts that the cinema can stand in as a crisis heterotopia, where audiences can experience the crisis of masculinity unfold without having to experience it themselves. The apocalypse in the <i>Mad Max</i> films is one of these crisis heterotopias. Traditional displays of masculinity, such as “physical strength, heterosexuality and survival skills are valued highly” in the apocalyptic landscape where Max resides.
      <div class="img-wrapper left">
        <img class="wrapped_img" src="/assets/imgs/posts/masculine-apocalypse/max_snake.png" alt="Max poised to catch an attacking snake">
        <div class="img-caption">Max poised to catch an attacking snake</div>
      </div>
      The apocalypse in the films serves as a masculine fantasy, a return to the crisis heterotopia of the wilderness, where the comforts of society are stripped away and only the strong survive. Much like Doyle shows with the novel Deliverance, the post-apocalypse serves to correct “the now ‘complicated’ category of masculinity” and redeems a “competitive hierarchy of who ‘can’t wait’ and those who ‘might cry’”. Max’s survival skills are shown again and again to save the day, as he catches a snake with his bare hands, or saves Papagallo’s settlers with his superior driving ability.</p>
      <p class="indented">If Max is our heterosexual hero of the wasteland, then the villains of the wasteland are the queer bikies that he does battle with. In the first film, <i>Mad Max</i> (1979), Max wages war with the bikies on Anarchie Road and his wife and daughter are taken from him in the process. In <i>Mad Max 2</i>, Max once again fights the bikies, this time clad in feathers and more overt S&M leather as part of Lord Humungus’ gang. Miller draws on gay and punk counterculture in the outfits that the bikies wear, while the settlers and Max’s outfits are distinctly different or toned down. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01956051.1985.10661996" class="normal-link">Christopher Sharrett suggests</a> that these bikies are clearly ‘othered’ by Miller, claiming that the bikies in the films “are indeed the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” in that they “suggest merely the evil that has been internalized by mankind.”
      <div class="img-wrapper right">
        <img class="wrapped_img" src="/assets/imgs/posts/masculine-apocalypse/bikies.png" alt="The Bikies in Humungus' gang">
        <div class="img-caption">The Bikies in Lord Humungus' gang</div>
      </div>
      In this way, he compares Miller’s depiction of the evil bikies as an example of “male escapist literature,” a world of “men without women.” Sharrett identifies Miller’s depiction of the world that the bikies inhabit as “apocalypticism both to the feminist movement, punk/new wave/gay culture, as well as to dominant ideology,” and Johinke identifies the space ruled by the bikies as “a metaphor for a dangerous and hellish homosocial environment.”</p>
      <p class="indented">It is clear, then, that Miller intends to pit the rugged individual heteronormative masculinity against the ‘deviant’ and pervasive homosexual environment. If this is the battle of <i>Mad Max 2</i>, then it is surely a battle that Max loses. Johinke addresses this, showing that the Gyro Captain in the film is desperate to obtain the role of Max’s ‘partner’, and by the end has achieved this goal, “The two men exchange a highly-charged 'look' which signals that their relationship has moved onto new ground.” Sharrett, too, speaks of this straying to homoerotic territory, stating that the film paints the apocalypse in a “cyclical view of history, with humanity in a transitional phase before the road back to civilization.”  This road back to civilization is found in freeing the settlers from Humungus’ gang, and creating a new society on the coast of Australia. But this society may be doomed as well, Sharrett suggests, “the last irony comes when the manic Gyro Captain becomes the new leader of the colonists, suggesting that the downward spiral of civilization has already begun again.” <i>Mad Max</i> and <i>Mad Max 2</i> are truly emblematic of the tension between Max, the old guard hyper-masculine heterosexual, and the deviance of the wasteland. If this is true, then Miller suggests an apocalypse to heteronormative society: the end of civilization is inextricably linked to the end of decency, a rise of deviance and homosexuality. What becomes apparent throughout the franchise is the insistence that there is little to separate Max from the craziness of the wasteland. In <i>Mad Max</i>, Max says that “any longer out there and I’m one of them.” In <i>Mad Max 2</i>, Papallago tells Max that “we [the settlers] are still human beings. You, you’re out there with the garbage.” The film holds a clear anxiety that there is little to keep the deviancy of the wasteland at bay, and that even our heroes–the archetypal symbols of masculinity–are not impervious to the looming threat of homosexuality. Max is then the last hold out of the old guard, a mythic western figure determined to keep the deviancy of the bikies at bay, an ultimately doomed quest. In this Win sees the American culture of the late 70s and 80s, a growing ‘Reaganized’ nationalism and fear of the ‘other’: the gay bikies that roam the wasteland.</p>
      <p class="indented">If <i>Mad Max 2</i> is the hyper-masculine 80s reactionary film that it proves to be, then <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> proves to be something entirely different. Initially, however, it appears to be more of the same. Miller opens the film similarly to <i>Mad Max 2</i>, with Max alone, wandering the open desert. Through opening narration, Max once again emphasizes the thin barrier between him and the crazies of the wasteland: “It was hard to know who was more crazy. Me, or everyone else.” It is quickly apparent, however, that the ‘other’ that the film portrays the residents of the wasteland as no longer draws from queer and punk culture but instead depicts a new form of insanity. This manifests itself in the war boys, the agents of the patriarchal dictator Immortan Joe. Taylor Boulware interrogates this group in <a href="https://issuu.com/mesjournal/docs/issuu-msj1-1_winter2016" class="normal-link">her article</a>, showing that Immortan Joe cultivates a toxic masculine culture in his army, where “War Boys compete over who can achieve the most spectacular death” and “always perform devotion to the patriarchal despot and aggressively abide by masculine protocols.” Here we see a different ‘othering’ than in <i>Mad Max 2</i>, where the madness of the wasteland now takes the form of a patriarchal capitalist society which breeds toxic masculinity in its troops. This reframing of the apocalyptic narrative immediately allows for a less reactionary narrative to unfold, where the danger of the apocalypse is no longer represented by the rise of deviancy, instead the threat of the apocalypse is now the unchecked aggression of toxic masculinity.</p>
      <p class="indented">Where, then, does the heteronormative figure of Max fit into this new narrative? Once Max is captured by the war boys, the film shifts its narrative to a new character, Imperator Furiosa. Max takes a backseat for most of the film, as Furiosa’s mission to get the ‘five wives’ to her childhood home of the green place takes center stage. Max, on the other hand, is used as a ‘blood bag’, strapped to the front of a war boy’s car and used for blood transfusions. Max’s placement with Joe’s army is no accident, and serves as the impetus for his journey throughout the film once he joins Furiosa in her escape.

        <div class="img-caption">Max fitted in a muzzle after escaping the war boys</div>
      </div>
      Michelle Yates notes this transformation in <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/674420" class="normal-link">her article</a>. Max begins the film as monstrous as the War Boys, moving erratically and “communicating mostly in grunts and gestures,” but through helping Furiosa and the wives, he gains agency. It is a common theme among the franchise to associate the people of the wasteland with animals and beasts. In <i>Mad Max 2</i>, the bikies in the wasteland are repeatedly described as subhuman, and Johinke describes “Miller’s repeated suggestion that they are closer to animals than human beings.” In <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, similar subhuman descriptors are levied at Joe and his War Boys; the wives often use the term “schlanger” when insulting them (this could be a wasteland animal or just something from Australia, it’s hard to tell). The villains of the wasteland are animalized, and indeed Max begins his journey fitted with a muzzle after an initial escape attempt. This restriction is emphasized by the sound design, once Furiosa offers Max a chisel to remove the muzzle, he furiously works away at it as a high pitched ringing plays. Once he rips the muzzle off, the sound becomes clearer, and there is an indication that some agency has been restored. What’s important here is that this freedom from animalistic association and restriction is only offered once Max begins to help Furiosa’s escape from Joe and his army. “It is in supporting the women on their journey, however reluctantly at first, that he [Max] finds his identity, voice and agency again” (Yates). This is emphasized when he tells a delirious Furiosa once Joe has been defeated: “Max. My name is Max.” Max is no longer the hyper-masculine lone wanderer defending the helpless against the deviancy of the homosocial wasteland, he now fights to defend those subjugated by the toxic masculinity and capitalistic oppression of Joe’s citadel. Max is redeemed in the film not through displays of toxic masculinity, but instead through empathy and denunciation of the patriarchal system.</p>
      <p class="indented">Max is hardly the main character of <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, however, the film spends much of its runtime following Furiosa instead. This shift in narrative framing is a symbol of the film moving past the framing of the ‘hyper-masculine hero vs. gay bikies’ and towards something less reactionary. Furiosa’s introduction is a key example of her journey throughout the film. Boulware notes how Furiosa is introduced as “the camera focuses on Immortan’s brand on the back of her neck”, and her “physical sex is ambiguous according to normative markers.” This introduction of Furiosa emphasizes her role in perpetuating the patriarchal system that Joe rules over. But we find that Furiosa has been victimized by the same system that she perpetuates, she tells Max that she was trafficked as a child away from her home, and her missing arm is a constant reminder of the violence that she has suffered under the system. Boulware states that Furiosa “is at once a victim of patriarchy and complicit in its perpetration.” which makes her quest throughout the film noble; she tells Max that she is simply looking for “retribution.” Like Max, Furiosa begins the film victimized and subjugated by the patriarchal system that Joe and his war boys perpetuate, and concludes the film having freed herself from this oppression.</p>
      <p class="indented"><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> is an action movie, of course, and with that territory typically comes the use of weapons and guns. Guns and bullets as symbols appear frequently throughout the film. One of the wives remarks that Angharad, another one of the five wives, called bullets “anti-seeds, plant one and watch something die.” Boulware addresses the symbol of guns in the film as “phallic objects and a tool of male violence and power.” Indeed, Joe and his war party frequently use guns haphazardly, spraying endlessly towards the war rig with little care. Once Angharad dies, Joe’s son Richtus unloads a minigun into the desert, even though Furiosa and the rig are much too far away to hit. Once Furiosa blinds the bullet farmer, he covers his eyes and sprays his machine guns haphazardly into the fog.
      <div class="img-wrapper right">
        <img class="wrapped_img" src="/assets/imgs/posts/masculine-apocalypse/blind.png" alt="The bullet farmer spraying his machine guns while blind">
        <div class="img-caption">The Bullet Farmer sprays his machine guns while blind</div>
      </div>
      With guns as a tool of male power, Joe’s war party frequently shoot them carelessly across the wasteland. Furiosa and Max do not abstain from the use of guns, however, and frequently do the opposite. Boulware notes of Furiosa’s skill with guns: “Furiosa is able to wield the phallic power at which she is so skilled … using patriarchy’s most potent weapon against it.” Max hands the gun to Furiosa when he realizes she is more able to hit the bullet farmer with it, and Furiosa’s skill with the phallic object is indicative of an alternative gender performance. Furiosa and Max are successful in freeing themselves and the wives from the patriarchal system because they “embrace a rejection of normative gender performances and hierarchies, which thus allows them to defeat their captor.” This representation of heroes is far and away from the representation in <i>Mad Max 2</i>, where alternative displays of gender and sexuality are demonized and ‘othered’.</p>
      <p class="indented">While the heroes and villains of <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> are recast in a more inclusive light, so too is the wasteland. The land inhabited in the film is much bleaker than it was in <i>Mad Max 2</i>, where once there was Australian bushlands now there is nothing but desert. The film draws attention to this when Nux, a defecting war boy, doesn’t know what a tree is. This bleak landscape sets the scene for Furiosa’s journey, a mission to return to her childhood home of ‘the green place’. Yates describes this journey as a traditional Hollywood “edenic recovery narrative.” She describes the tendency to represent nature as the garden of Eden, a “pristine garden of natural delight” that has been destroyed or lost because of a “culpable human act that results in environmental degradation.” The mission then becomes to regain the lost garden, and this is exactly what Furiosa intends to do. But upon arrival at the garden, Furiosa and crew find that the garden is gone, lost because the many mothers could not grow anything on the now sour earth. They decide to head back and take Immortan Joe’s citadel for themselves, and overthrow the patriarchal capitalist system that has been chasing them throughout the film. Yates states that this disrupts the traditional edenic recovery narrative, by asserting that “the film recasts nature as a space of feminist possibility” by framing “women's liberation from patriarchal power” as “predicated upon the liberation of nature from this same system of power and oppression.” It is here that the distinction from <i>Mad Max 2</i> is most apparent. Whereas the wasteland in <i>Mad Max</i> is something that must be escaped–Papagallo and his settlers use Max to escape the settlement and head for their own garden of eden on the coast–<i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> decides that the paradise has already been lost, and that a new paradise must be created by dismantling the toxic society that already exists in the wasteland.</p>
      <p class="indented"><i>Mad Max 2</i> serves as an entirely reactionary film, one that portrays the threat to society as queer culture, ‘otherizes’ homosexual tendencies, and portrays heroes as hyper-masculine heterosexual figures. In comparison, <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> (2015) instead portrays the threat to society as toxic masculinity and unchecked capitalism and shows how heroes can subvert gender roles to dismantle this system and build a feminist utopia from its ashes. To be fair to <i>Mad Max 2</i>, both films are clear products of their cultural time, with the 80s representing a rise in conservatism across America it is no surprise that the film succeeded like it did in the US. <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> was slammed by Men’s rights groups and reactionary bloggers, ironically furthering its case of concern for the apocalypticism of toxic masculinity. And while <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i> may not be a perfect feminist piece (the creators behind the scenes were almost exclusively men), it still represents growth in the post-apocalypse and action genre.</p>
